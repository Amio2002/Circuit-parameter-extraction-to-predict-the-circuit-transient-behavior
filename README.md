# Circuit-parameter-extraction-to-predict-the-circuit-transient-behavior

Project Description:
In this project we have tried to find the relationship between electro-mechanical characteristics of a DC motor by solving various problems. Part A of the project focuses on regression and curve fitting concepts. From which we got the values of R and L. Part B of the project reflects numerical solutions of differential Equations using finite difference methods and mainly focus on electrical and mechanical attributes of a DC motor.
